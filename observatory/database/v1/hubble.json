Sufficiently bright stars without good FUSE data in the archive will also be observed with the COS c1096 setting to provide coverage at shorter wavelengths.

The filters are: \nACS/SBC/F150LP\nACS/SBC/F165LP\nWFC3/UVIS/F438W\nWFC3/UVIS/F547M\nWFC3/UVIS/F850LP\n\nFor each target we execute two visits: \n- one for ACS/SBC, which is 2 orbits in every case except for one (Visit 35 for Target 18)\n- one for WFC3/UVIS, which is 1 orbit in every case.\n\nSBC Visits\n--------------\nThe goal is to obtain images in F150LP and F165LP over a 4-step dithering pattern.  \n\nWe use the standard 'SBC' aperture, and dither the object away from the dead pixel rows.\n\nThis is implemented using POS-TARGs, specifically designed to do sub-pixel dithering (integer pixel + 1/4 pixel steps in x,y) over an extended larger pattern; this will both recover the core of the point-spread function and average over low frequency uncertainties in the flat-fielding and improve sensitivity to low surface brightness light.  The approach goes:\n{F150LP, F165LP} -- dither -- {F165LP, F150LP} -- dither -- {F150LP, F165LP} -- dither -- {F165LP, F150LP}\nplacing each pair of images in the two filters on exactly the same position, and giving us 4 images per filter.   Typical frame exposure times are 550 sec in F150LP and 730 sec in F165LP.\n\nOur *Special Requirement*, as specified in the phase 1 application applies to these visits: \n\nTo minimize the dark current, SBC visits should be executed only when the SBC has not\nbeen used in the last 24 hours, and the MAMA detector has been allowed to cool.  This will require attention at the point of scheduling.  This requirement is also mentioned as a Comment in each SBC visit.  \n\nETC calculations are done for the FUV magnitude of each source computed from GALEX observations at a wavelengh of 1527 AA.  This is effectively equivalent to the wavelength of observations in F150LP and F165LP.  We always assume a flat continuum in f_nu (accurate for these blue galaxies) and that the sources are point-like (which they are not, but the assumption is conservative from a safety perspective).   \n\nUVIS Visits\n--------------\nThe goal is to obtain images in F438W, F547M, and F850LP.   These orbits are tight, and 6 full-frame readouts of UVIS are obtained per orbit, giving two images in each filter.  The observations are dithered to improve hot/bad pixel rejection and recover the point-spread function.  The approach goes: \n{F438W} -- dither -- {F438W} -- dither-back -- {F547M} -- dither -- {F547M} -- dither-back -- {F850LP} -- dither -- {F850LP}\n\nIn order not to incur additional overhead from buffer dump between exposures, we keep all integration times above 348 seconds, except for the first image in the orbit which is allowed to be shorter.  F850LP images at the end of the orbit are typically somewhat longer. \n\nEach observation is post-flashed using a number of electrons calculated by the Exposure Time Calculator."}, "Monitoring Earendel, the Lensed z~6 Star": {"title": "Monitoring Earendel, the Lensed z~6 Star", "link": "https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?id=16668&mission=hst", "pubDate": "Sat, 29 Oct 2022 13:36:25 +0000", "img": "https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr15/SkyServerWS/ImgCutout/getjpeg?TaskName=Skyserver.Chart.List&ra=24.354&dec=-7.543&scale=0.79224&width=600&height=600&opt=LG", "desc": "We will obtain 4 orbits of WFC3/IR F110W imaging of WHL0137-08, aligned with the previous HST imaging of that galaxy cluster core.

For the remaining 6 galaxies the new F336W observations will be paired with our pre-existing ACS/WFC F435W and F814W observations. The ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS cameras have comparable fields of view (202\"x202\" and 162\"x162\", respectively), and cover sufficient area to enable observations of these LIRGs in a single pointing.\n\nThe clusters observed in this sample of LIRGs have M_V= -8 to -16 mag and apparent F435W (B) magnitudes typically in the range B ~ 21-25.5 mag. We have made use of instantaneous starburst models from Bruzual & Charlot (2003) to estimate the observed magnitudes in the F336W filter. For a 100 Myr starburst (F336W - F435W = -0.53 mag) and a conservative apparent magnitude of B=25.5 mag, we find that we can reach a signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, of approximately 10 with F336W, F438W, and F814W in roughly 2600, 1300, and 1300 seconds respectively. Note that if the clusters are younger, their spectral energy distributions peak even higher in bluer filters, and are therefore 1-2 magnitudes brighter than described above. Thus, in the absence of dust, the achieved SNR will be significantly higher. \n\nWe model our observing strategy based on other studies of star clusters in luminous infrared galaxies (GO 14066 and GO 15472) and use a custom 4-pt dither pattern for each source designed to (1) remove the gap between the chips (1.2 arcsec) (2) sub-sample the PSF (half pixel or a third of a pixel shift have been included if the pattern is a multiple of 2 or 3, respectively), and (3) to remove droplets (shift of 4 arcsec required). The 4-pointing pattern has the following coordinates in arcsec: (0,0), (-3.69,1.31), (-2.5, -2.44), (1.19,-3.75). For the F438W we modify the WFC3-UVIS-GAP-LINE patten to include a third pointing at (0,0). For the F814W we adopt the standard WFC3-UVIS-GAP-LINE pattern. Thus the patterns are  (0,0), (-0.092, -1.203), (0.092, 1.203) and (-0.089, -1.203), (0.089, 1.203) respectively.\n\nFurther, the main body of the galaxy has been placed at the UVIS2-FIX location (which is more sensitive in the UV, and therefore, optimal to detect clusters), or at the UVIS-FIX location in order to fully map the galaxy if it has very extended tidal features. We use the latter aperture for VV340A, UGC5101, NGC5135, and Mrk 273. Finally, we observe in the ACCUM mode, and include a FLASH of 10 seconds with the CR_SPLIT=NO parameter to mitigate CTE losses. \n\nThe data reduction and calibration of new and archival data will be done using the standard HST pipeline. IRAF, IDL and python will be used for additional data reduction and photometry within metric apertures. The cluster analysis will be done by using Source Extractor to identify clusters and IDL routines to extract aperture measurements of clusters and calculate luminosities. Similar analysis has been done on other F336W, F435W, and F814W datasets (Linden et al. 2017, 2021).

We have had to use 3 visits instead of one to solve two error messages from the APT software: (PHASE CRITICAL VISIT HAS PHASE WINDOW LARGER THAN PERIOD; and TOO MANY SUBEXPOSURES IN ONE GROUP (REQUEST HELP FROM YOUR PC)). We have also placed a constraint on the second and third \"visits\" to ensure that all 22 orbits be collected at the same orientation angle as the first orbit to increase our ability to decorrelate detector systematics and to allow for subtraction of the nearby companion stars. We anticipate there being a need for gyro bias updates and SAA crossing(s), but have not entered any parameters related to this into the APT software. However, two good opportunities for brief interruptions in the observations are at the breaks between visits which are at times not expected to impact the transit, eclipse, or maximum/minimum points of the phasecurve."}}}
